# Spectra_Tools

Contains useful functions and tools for analysing spectra in chemistry.

# NMR

This package contains several useful utilities for analysing NMR spectra.

The first is a similarity based on a tree-representation of an spectra.

The algorithm was based on the following papers:

<ol>
    <li>
        [A new method for the comparison of <sup>1</sup>H NMR predictors based on tree-similarity of spectra](https://doi.org/10.1186/1758-2946-6-9)
    </li>
    <li>
        [Fast and shift-insensitive similarity comparisons of NMR using a tree-representation of spectra](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2013.05.009)
    </li>
</ol>

Code in this repository is a conversion from the original [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mljs/tree-similarity).
